I’m a passionate builder who learns by breaking complex problems down and rebuilding them better.

My focus is on Cloud & Backend Engineering architecting resilient distributed systems with Go, and streamlining infrastructure using Docker and modern DevOps practices. I strive to make software not just functional, but scalable.

Offline, I’m an explorer at heart, chasing sunrises and sunsets for perspective.
