In my experience, I’ve worked on projects at the intersection of AI, Backend Engineering, and System Architecture. I designed the global architecture for a multi-agent system integrated with a CRM application, implementing asynchronous communication with Redis and intelligent workflows using LangGraph. I also contributed to X-GATE, an AI-powered platform for businesses, where I built data ingestion pipelines and RAG workflows.

Beyond development, I focused on infrastructure and reproducibility by setting up full-stack Docker environments and implementing tracing for agent performance. These projects reflect my drive to build scalable, production-ready solutions that bridge the gap between intelligent algorithms and solid engineering.
