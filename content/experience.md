In my experience, I’ve worked on projects at the intersection of AI, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. I developed a multi-agent system integrated with a CRM application, designed intelligent workflows with supervisor–agent architectures, and contributed to XGATE, a data-driven platform empowering Moroccan businesses with insights and decision support.

 Beyond AI, I built practical applications such as a fitness mobile app leveraging gamification and personalized tracking, and a desktop Clubs Manager system for ENSAM Meknès to streamline student club administration. These projects reflect my drive to build impactful, scalable solutions that blend technical innovation with real-world utility.
