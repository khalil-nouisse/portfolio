I’m a passionate builder who thrives on tackling complex problems and turning ideas into reality. Breaking things down, experimenting, and rebuilding is how I learn best—it’s where curiosity meets creativity.


My work spans AI, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering, with a focus on backend systems, multi-agent architectures, and intelligent applications. I love exploring how different technologies and ideas intersect to create innovative solutions.

When I’m not coding or experimenting, you’ll find me outdoors, chasing sunrises and sunsets for inspiration and perspective.
